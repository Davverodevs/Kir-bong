# Kir-bong is a fan-game in its alpha phase (deadline: 01.11.2023)
Main idea: The classical PONG game but with kirby as the MC/Star
Proposals: PONG game -> Fighting game -> Racing game

TODO:
-Make Welcome Menu cuter and give it more functions (WIP)!!!
-Make Menu Buttons display vertically and centered
-Add to Welcome Menu
  -Multiplayer option (Party mode)!!!
    -Players can choose a character? (unblock them with story mode?)
  -Change Settings 
    -Difficulty (easy, normal, hard, insane?)!!! 
      -IDEA: multiply number of each level by Difficulty (easy= x0.5, normal = x1, hard = x1.5, insane = 2.0?)
    -Languages (en, es, fr, de, it?, pt?, ...?)
-Elaborate more on "Story Mode"?
  -Give it a Story?
