# Kir-bong is a fan-game in its alpha phase (deadline: 01.11.2023)
Main idea: The classical PONG game but with kirby as the MC/Star
Proposals: PONG game (first) -> Fighting game (third) -> Racing game (second)

Nice to have:
-Make Welcome Menu cuter
  -Menu Buttons display vertically and centered
-Elaborate more on "Story Mode"
  -Give it a 'Story'
